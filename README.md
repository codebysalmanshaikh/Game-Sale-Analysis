🎭 Role-Playing & Platform also hold significant shares

💡 Gamers prefer action-driven, competitive, and sports-oriented titles.


4. Sales Trends Over the Years

📈 1980–1990s: Early gaming era with modest sales

🚀 2000–2010: Explosive growth, peak with PS2, Xbox 360, Wii

📉 Post-2010: Sales decline (likely due to digital distribution not captured here)

💡 The 2000s were the golden age of physical game sales.


🎮 Video Game Sales Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project explores a dataset of global video game sales to uncover insights about platforms, genres, publishers, and regional trends.
The focus is on descriptive analytics — understanding patterns and trends, rather than predicting future sales.

Through Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python, this project demonstrates core data analysis skills, including:

Data cleaning & preparation

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

SQL querying for business insights

Visualization with Excel & Power BI

Storytelling with data

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Excel → Data cleaning, Pivot tables, Charts

Power BI → Interactive dashboard creation

MySQL → Data querying & aggregation

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn) → Deeper exploration (planned in next steps)
